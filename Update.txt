Problem with old code stemmed from the fact that is saved all results of the intermeadiate steps.


Following list attributes were chnaged in the Optimizer class:
self.yield_per_iter  (Stored as floats)
self.sim_observables (Stored as a dict) chaged to (Stored at int and float)
self.parameter_history  (Stored as numpy arrays)
self.final_yields       (Stored as a list of Tensor)  changed to (Stored as a list of int)
self.dimer_max           (Stored as a list of Tensor)  changed to (Stored as a list of int)
self.chap_max            (Stored as a list of Tensor)  changed to (Stored as a list of int)
self.endtimes            (Stored as a list of Tensor)  changed to (Stored as a list of int)
self.final_solns        (Stored as a list of Tensor) changed to (Stored as a list of arr(2))
self.final_t50        (Stored as a list of Tensor)    changed to (Stored as a list of int and float)
self.final_t85        (Stored as a list of Tensor)    changed to (Stored as a list of int and float)
self.final_t95        (Stored as a list of Tensor)    changed to (Stored as a list of int and float)
self.final_t99        (Stored as a list of Tensor)    changed to (Stored as a list of int and float)
self.final_unused_mon (Stored as a list of Tensor)  changed to (Stored as a list of int)
self.curr_time        (Stored as a list of Tensor)  changed to (Stored as a list of int)
self.flux_per_iter    (code was missing parts for incorporation of flux, got rid)

Additionally:
Deleted plot_observable method
Deleted commented out parts


Memory usage ~15Mb -> ~14kB at 100 iter or ~0.5Kb at 1,000 per iteration (Probably const, to check would need to run at 10^4, 10^5, 10^6 iter etc).

IN TEMPLATES FOLDER:
Optimization_Template block 11: changed expected types of yield and solutions info from tensor to arrays/floats/int

IN TEST_RUNS FOLDER:
trimer_Optimization block 11: changed expected types of yield and solutions info from tensor to arrays/floats/int
trimer_predict_rates-Copy1 block 9: changed expected types of yield and solutions info from tensor to arrays/floats/int

IN RESULTS FOLDER:
IN RATEGROWTH FOLDER:
ap2_maximization_new block9: changed expected types of yield and solutions info from tensor to arrays/floats/int
ap2_maximization_new block10 original code did not work; made some changes for the graph to show up. Probably not a desired graph but at least it shows up
AP2_Simulations_only block8: change %matplotlib notebook to %matplotlib inline

IN EXPRATEPREDICTION FOLDER:
Trimer_Simulations_only block 9: change %matplotlib notebook to %matplotlib inline; Delete block 13
trimer_predict_rates block 8 ???
Tetramer_GenerateSimdata block 9: change %matplotlib notebook to %matplotlib inline; Block 13: Missing a file
