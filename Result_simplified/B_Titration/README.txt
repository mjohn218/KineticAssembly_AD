Single: only one monomer gets added
Multi: multiple monomers get added
species same format;
rules the same, some reactions would have to have the word null for the ones you want to titrate; ex null<->A(a) G=0
single titration is just adding a single speacies and seeing if it escapes or is trapped; seeing one line is normal;
multiple titration is where you actually want to play around =with titration and let the hierarchy of different rates andsee what happens;
